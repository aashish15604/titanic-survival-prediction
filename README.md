# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains passenger details such as:
- Gender
- Age
- Passenger class
- Fare
- Family members onboard

## Approach
- Data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Feature encoding
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation

## Results
- Model accuracy: ~79%
- Females had a higher survival rate than males
- Children had a higher survival rate than adults

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project shows how basic machine learning techniques can be used to analyze and predict survival outcomes.
